# personal-website-v1
This is my personal website that I developed from scratch to 
showcase some of the cool projects that I've been working on. 

This site was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS. All of the 
HTML can currently be found in the index.html file. The CSS
is in the css folder which contains seperate css
files for each of the sections of the website. The JS is 
located in the js folder and is also seperated into 
distinct files according to function. Finally, all the
images, files, and other resources are tucked away in the
res folder.

Feel free to any of the code, but just keep in mind
that I've spent quite some developing this from scratch
and would greatly appreciate some credit if you do use
any of the code.
