# My Portfolio Website 
This is my personal website that I developed from scratch to showcase some of the cool projects that I've been working on. You can see it for yourself at [kavpreetgrewal.com](https://kavpreetgrewal.github.io/personal-website-v1/).

This site was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS. All of the HTML can currently be found in the index.html file. The CSS is in the css folder which contains seperate css files for each of the sections of the website. The JS is located in the js folder and is also seperated into distinct files according to function. Finally, all the images, files, and other resources are tucked away in the res folder.

## Usage/Contributions
Feel free to use any of the code, but just keep in mind that I've spent quite some developing this from scratch and would greatly appreciate some credit if you do use any of the code. Also if you feel like there should be any changes or encounter any bugs, create an issue or send a pull request.
